# BRHC
Bible Readings for the Home Circle

## Flutter App
This repository contains the Flutter app for **Biblical Heritage: Bible Readings for the Home (1914 Edition)**.
The Flutter project now lives at the BRHC root (no nested Flutter root).

## Development
Use the `dlbr` alias from the BRHC root to clean, fetch packages, and run the macOS app:

```
flutter clean
flutter pub get
flutter run -d macos
```
